The based paper is https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10928.
During the paper, they implemented Quantum Phase Estimation to calculate the cost. They put the code to the paper in the way of OpenQASM. I am not familiar with OpenQASM, I rewrite it in a usual way to write quantum circuits using Qiskit. Please install Qiskit before implemeting this code.
